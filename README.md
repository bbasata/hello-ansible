In this show-and-tell of automating infrastructure, we deploy a
database-backed PHP application to multiple machines.

`How to Install.txt` is a write-up of the steps we might perform
manually to configure our machines. In the presentation, we automate
these steps one at a time, and the result is the `site.yml` playbook and
the `farm` inventory file.
